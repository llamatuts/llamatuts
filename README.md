# Deploying to github pages

1. Clone https://github.com/llamatuts/llamatuts.github.io into the root directory of the project.
2. Rename the folder to _site. Now everytime you run `jekyll serve` it will build all the static assets and put them into the _site folder.
3. To push to production, cd into _site and run `git commit -m "Your message" && git push"`
