<h1> About Us </h1>
Llama tuts is a collaboration between Wendy Beth, Jimmy Lo and Jonathan Yeong.

Why llama's? Well:

1. They're cute
2. They probably don't know how to code.

Our tutorials are geared towards beginners who are at the llama level (or something like this).

Here's an introduction on the authors
