I am a long post. Let go of the need to analyze and let be. You can get
through this. You can do what you set out to do; yes, you can.
Briefly notice any emotions,
thoughts or sensations that may be driving fear and anxiety and learn to let
them be. Let go of the need to analyze and let be. Stop and focus on
whatever is being carried within you and let be. May you be safe. Anxiety
and panic will pass.
